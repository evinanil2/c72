         The current Romanesque and Gothic form of the cathedral, seen today in the Stephansplatz, was largely initiated by Duke Rudolf IV (1339–1365) and stands on the ruins of two earlier churches, the first a parish church consecrated in 1147.
          The most important religious building in Vienna, St. Stephen's Cathedral has borne witness to many important events in Habsburg and Austrian history and has, with its multi-coloured tile roof, become one of the city's most recognizable symbols</p>

             The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology.
             "[1] A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering.
             "[2] School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."[3]</p>

        <p>Pollution is one of the greatest challenges the world is facing today. It is the introduction of harmful pollutants in the environment that degrades the quality of air, water, and soil. As human civilization progressed, we invented machines and products that can ease our life. During this process, we exploited nature, and started polluting it. We are in a time of crisis where the glaciers in Antarctica are melting due to global warming. Pollution not only affects the environment but also introduces diseases that could kill all living organisms. Toxic chemicals released in water have killed aquatic life and also reduced the quality of water. Toxic gasses released in the air cause different lung diseases such as asthma etc. More and more legislative acts are passed to control pollution and it has been adopted by governments all around the world. However, only legislative acts and protocols cannot help in controlling the pollution as it is the duty of every individual to act on his or her own to control pollution. It is also very important that children from an early age should be educated about pollution and the effect it has on the environment and their future.</p>

   <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A smart attendance management system will help you track Student hours, ensuring there are no policy or regulatory violations. It also goes a long way in simplifying payroll. We look at ten key attendance management system features, including: 

    Must-haves: clocking in/out, leave management, payroll, and reporting
    Nice-to-haves: biometrics, missed alerts, and calendars
    Differentiators: mobile and cloud support, self-service, and analytics
    When building a digitally enabled work environment, a sophisticated platform for attendance management becomes essential. Not only is it responsible for maintaining visibility on employee movements, but attendance management systems can also simplify compliance.
    
    Different countries, states, or regions all follow varying regulatory mandates around working hours, compensation, and time off. A digital attendance management system keeps track of these details, making the audit process much easier.</p>
